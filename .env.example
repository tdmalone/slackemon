# Set these as environment variables, or, if running in a development environment, copy this file
# to .env and set them here. If you're not using Docker Compose, you will need to set APP_ENV as an
# environment variable to 'development' for this file to be read by PHP dotenv.

# Configure the data cache/store.
# Local is generally recommended, unless of course you're hosting on a service with a ephemeral
# filesystem. The data cache cannot be disabled - it is required to run Slackémon.

# 'aws', 'local' or 'postgres' (AWS is not recommended for this option; S3 is not best for
# regularly changing data).
SLACKEMON_DATA_STORE_METHOD=local

# 'aws' or 'local' (when AWS is used, a backup local cache will be kept to reduce costs - great for
# ephemeral filesystems).
SLACKEMON_DATA_CACHE_METHOD=local

# Local data folder for use if 'local' is set for either of the above options.
# This folder is also used regardless as a temporary scratchpad & to augment other caching options.
SLACKEMON_DATA_FOLDER=.data

# Only required if using aws for either of the above options.
# Make sure that this bucket limits read access to the AWS details you provide below.
SLACKEMON_DATA_BUCKET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Configure the image cache - two methods are supported; either local, or via an AWS S3 bucket (or
# you can disable). You should use the AWS option unless you are hosting Slackémon on a suitably
# fast server/connection. Please do NOT disable the image cache unless doing so for a short time
# for testing - otherwise it will cause unfair load for the external media resources that Slackémon
# uses.

# 'aws', 'local', or 'disabled'.

# Postgres access details.
# Only required if using 'postgres' for the data store above.
